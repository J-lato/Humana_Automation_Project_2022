//This program uses a LinkedIn client (which would need to be implemented separately) to authenticate with LinkedIn and search for connections based on a keyword entered by the user. It then connects with the first 10 connections in the search results.

//This is just a simple example, and a real LinkedIn connection program would likely be more complex and include additional features and functionality. It is important to note that LinkedIn has policies in place to prevent spam and other types of abusive behavior, and it is important to use the platform responsibly and ethically.
